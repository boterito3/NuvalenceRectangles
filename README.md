# NuvalenceRectangles

This is an standard console app built in .Net Core 3.1, so it can be executed in any OS.

The NuvalanceRectangles project, contains the implementation of the Engine and the Rectangle class. 

It Also contains a basic console app that will require you to define the coordinates of 2 rectangles, then it will run the analysis and show results.

The NuvalanceRectangles.Tests project, contains the respective tests.

### This is a work in progress project, I still have the following things pending:
1. In the method GetIntersectionPoints I should return only the 2 pints where the interception happens, not the 4 coordinates of the interception rectangle
2. The logic of the method GetAdjacencyType is not 100% accurate, there are some edge cases that need to be considered
